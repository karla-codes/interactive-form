# Interactive Form

This is the third project in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree through Treehouse.

## Objective

Use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

## Extra Credit

Optional extra credit tasks that I've added to this project:

- Prevent users from registering or conflicting activities
- Add real-time error message to at least one required field
- Add a conditional error message to at least one required field
